SECURITY NOTES
--------------

This file will be used as a security alert mechanism.
Please "watch" this file under github.  If a security
notification is needed, this file will be edited and
you will be alerted via email.

Currently there are no known security issues, although
remote access is not supported directly by the software
provided.

You should be aware that providing remote access to ROS
is not secure without a VPN, and you may have to do some
additional configuration of Ubuntu itself to enable able
and secure even basic remote access. See
[sawr_master/INSTALL.md].
