Simple Autonomous Wheeled Robot (SAWR)
======================================
Making a Frame
--------------
Frame, driver and wheel components are laser cut from two Acrylic or POM sheets: 
one 2mm thick and the second 3mm thick.

Acrylic is perfectly fine and is low-cost, but POM (also known as Acetal, 
Delrin, or Duracon) is more durable and is recommended for heavy use, such as
in a classroom, or if you need to transport the robot frequently. Using Acrylic
only for the 2mm sheet but POM for the 3mm sheet is also possible and gives
most of the benefit of using POM alone.

If you just want to laser-cut the file, start with the PDF file, being careful
not to resize it. If you do not have access to the size of sheet specified in
the PDF file, you can rearrange the parts using a 2D vector graphics editor 
such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), which is free. In this case, you 
want to start from the SVG file. If you need to rearrange the file with Adobe 
Illustrator, however, start from the PDF file, as Adobe Illustrator tends to
resize SVG on import. 

The lines in these files have been colored red and blue. Red lines should be 
cut first, followed by the blue lines (i.e. Trotec conventions). Basically,
the outline of a part needs to be cut last so it is only freed from the main
sheet once all interior features have been cut. Depending on your laser cutter
(i.e. if you have a Universal laser cutter), you may have to modify the colors
to get the right cutting order. Depending on the laser cutter model the cut
time is between 24 min to 1 hr.  

### Sheet 1 
You can access the cut files locally.  Use the appropriate format for your
laser cutter.  PDF is generally recommended unless you need to do editing.
Use one of the following to cut parts from a 2mm sheet of either Acrylic or POM:
* [Local Laser Cut file for 2mm sheet in SVG format](Make/2mm.svg)
* [Local Laser Cut file for 2mm sheet in PDF format](Make/2mm.pdf)

### Sheet 2:
If you are using Acrylic, use one of these files to cut a 3mm sheet:
* [Local Laser Cut file for 3mm sheet in SVG format](Make/3mm_acrylic.svg)
* [Local Laser Cut file for 3mm sheet in PDF format](Make/3mm_acrylic.pdf)

If you are using POM and want a cantilevered suspension, use one of the 
following files instead for the 3mm sheet:
* [Local Laser Cut file for 3mm sheet in SVG format for POM](Make/3mm_pom.svg)
* [Local Laser Cut file for 3mm sheet in PDF format for POM](Make/3mm_pom.pdf)
