Here is all the information you need to build your own SAWR!

  1. Bills of materials (BOMs) are located under [Materials](Materials). Visit
     the [SAWR project page at 01.org](https://01.org/sawr) to see if kits are
     available. Alternatively you can just source all the parts yourself; links
     are provided to McMaster-Carr and Amazon but other sources can also be
     used as the parts are generally standard.

  2. If you want to cut your own frame, laser-cut files (and 
     [instructions](Make/README.md) on how to use them) are located in the 
     [Make](Make) subdirectory. 

  3. Under the [Models](Models) subdirectory you will find the source CAD
     files. SAWR is modeled using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), an
     open-source 3D parametric modeling system. Using OpenSCAD, models are
     actually described using a textual language, not a direct manipulation
     graphical interface. The main file is `frame.scad`.

  4. Build instructions are located in [ASSEMBLY.md](ASSEMBLY.md).

  5. Further information on the build process, videos, etc will be posted to
     the [SAWR project at 01.org](https://01.org/sawr).
