# Simple Autonomous Wheeled Robot (SAWR) Hardware

Here is all the information you need to build your own SAWR!
  1. Bills of materials are located under [Assembly](Assembly).
  Visit the [SAWR project page at 01.org](https://01.org/sawr) to see if kits are available.
  Alternatively you can just source all the parts yourself
  2. If you want to cut your own frame, laser-cut files are located in CUT.
  Use the version appropriate to your material.
  Acetal is highly recommended if you can source it.
  Acyrlic is ok but not as sturdy.
  If your sheets have different dimensions you may have to reorganize the parts 
  a little bit using a vector graphics editor such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
  Note that one 2mm thick sheet and one 3mm thick sheet are used.
  The design allows for 10% tolerance in sheet thickness, and is really only important for the 3mm sheet.
  Consider this if you can only source sheets in Imperial thicknesses. 
  3. Under Modules you will find the CAD files.
  SAWR is modeled using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), an open-source 3D parametric modelling system.
  The main file is ``frame.scad``.
  4. Build instructions are located in [Assembly/Instructions.pdf](Assembly/Instructions.pdf).
