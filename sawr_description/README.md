# Simple Autonomous Wheeled Robot (SAWR) Description Package

This package provide descriptions and models for the SAWR.
  1. Under [hardware](hardware/README.md), you will find a BOM, OpenSCAD files,
  PDF files for laser-cutting a frame, and complete build instructions for a SAWR.
  2. URDF files are also provided.
  The master files are given in XACRO and the URDF files are generated from them.
  Launch files are provided for publishing this data to the rest of the system.
  The URDF/XACRO model is currently very simple, and is just meant for visualization.
