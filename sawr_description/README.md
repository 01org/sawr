Simple Autonomous Wheeled Robot (SAWR) Description Package
==========================================================

This package provide URDF descriptions and models for the SAWR. The master 
files are given in XACRO and the URDF files are generated from them. Launch 
files are provided for publishing this data to the rest of the system. The 
URDF/XACRO model is currently very simple, and is just meant for visualization
and collision detection.

If you are looking for instructions and CAD models to actually
build a SAWR, look in the [sawr_hardware](../sawr_hardware/README.md) package, 
you will find a bill of materials (BOMi), OpenSCAD files, PDF files for 
laser-cutting a frame, and build instructions.
